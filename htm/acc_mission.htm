<h1>Mission Support Accessories</h1>

<p>In addition to the equipment that is included with each Pro 4 <!--1--> Ultra<!--/1--> configuration and the commercially available accessories, VideoRay recommends users procure a variety of mission support items.  The list of recommended items will vary depending on the typical mission requirements, although it will be obvious that some of these items have general applicability to all mission profiles.</p>

<p>These brief lists are intended to provide a sample and stimulate thinking about what you might want to add to your "operations kit:"</p>

<h2>General Logistical Support</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Basic operations support items including tables and chairs, foul weather gear, food, water, etc.</li>
  <li>Power sources including generators and batteries/inverters</li>
  <li>Video display and recording devices</li>
  <li>Tools and spare parts</li>
  <li>Software and media<p></p></li>
  </ul>

<h2>Tactical Operations Support</h2>
