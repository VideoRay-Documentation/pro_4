<h1>Dell 4000 Series Computers</h1>

<p>The Dell 4000 series computers have been set up with a "VideoRay" user account and there is no password assigned.</p>

<p>The mount that holds the computer to the control panel is designed to tilt to provide optimal viewing of the second monitor if one is available and to allow easier access to the side ports.  To tilt the computer, lift it straight up and then pull it towards the operator.  As it comes towards the operator, the back will start to drop.  Continue pulling until the back rests on the control panel.</p>

<p><img src="../../required/images/icon_note.png"> On models prior to the 4800 the two USB 3.0 ports on the right hand side of the computer are not compatible with the VideoRay Pro 4<!--1--> Ultra<!--/1--><!--3--> Lite<!--/3--> control panel and should not be used to connect the computer to the control panel.</p>
