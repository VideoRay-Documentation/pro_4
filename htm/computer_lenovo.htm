<h1>Lenovo Yoga Tablet</h1>

<p>The Lenovo Yoga has been set up with a "VideoRay" user account and there is no password assigned.</p>

<p>The mount that holds the computer to the control panel is designed to tilt to provide optimal viewing and to allow easier access to the side ports.  The computer can also be flipped to allow it to be used in tablet mode or laptop mode.</p>
