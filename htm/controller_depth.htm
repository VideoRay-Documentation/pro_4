<h1>Depth Control</h1>

<p>The Depth Control knob is used to make the ROV dive or surface by controlling the direction and amount of vertical thrust.</p>

<h2>Use</h2>

<p>Rotate the Depth Control knob forward (counterclockwise) to dive.  The greater the rotation from the center position, the faster it will dive.  Rotate the Depth Control knob backward (clockwise) to surface.  The greater the rotation from the center position, the faster it will surface.</p>

<p><img src="../../required/images/icon_caution.png"> Do not run the vertical thruster in air for an extended period of time.  Doing so may cause overheating and damage to the components.</p>

<h2>Using the Depth Control Knob with Auto Depth</h2>

<p>The label indicates the action of the ROV relative to the surface of the water.  When the line on the Depth Control knob is rotated below the center line, the ROV will dive.  When the line on the Depth Control knob is rotated above the center line of the label, the ROV will move towards the surface.  When the line on the Depth Control knob is aligned with the center line of the label the action of the ROV will depend upon that status of Auto Depth.</p>

<p>If Auto Depth is Off and the Depth Control Knob is centered, there will be no vertical thrust (the ROV may drift vertically depending up its buoyancy and the presence of vertical currents).  If Auto Depth is On and the Depth Control Knob is centered, the system will apply vertical thrust as necessary to maintain the current depth.  You can rotate the Depth Control Know while Auto Depth is engaged and the ROV will surface or dive to a new depth.  When you recenter the Depth Control Knob, the ROV will maintain the new depth.</p>
