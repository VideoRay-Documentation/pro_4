<h1>Joystick</h1>

<p>The joystick is used to control the horizontal motion of the ROV.</p>

<p><img src="../../required/images/icon_note.png"> The Joystick does not have a label.</p>

<h2>Use</h2>

<p>Displace the joystick forward (away from you) to move the ROV forward.  Displace the joystick rearward (toward you) to move the ROV backward.  Displace the Joystick to the left to turn the ROV to its left.  Displace the Joystick to the right to turn the ROV to its right.  The greater the displacement from the center position, the faster it will move or turn in that direction.</p>

<p>The joystick can be moved in any direction to simultaneously turn while moving forward or backward.</p>

<p><img src="../../required/images/icon_caution.png"> Do not run the horizontal thrusters in air for an extended period of time.  Doing so may cause overheating and damage to the components.</p>

<h2>Using the Joystick with Auto Heading</h2>

<p>When Auto Heading is engaged, the system will try to maintain the heading of the ROV.  You can displace the joystick forward and backward and the ROV will not yaw.  If you displace the joystick to the right or the left, the ROV will yaw and when you center the joystick, the ROV will maintain the new heading.  See the <a href="../../pro_4/html<!--1-->_ultra<!--/1-->/pilot_auto_heading.html">Auto Heading</a> section of the <a href="../../pro_4/html<!--1-->_ultra<!--/1-->/oper_.html">Operations Guide</a> for more information about using Auto Heading.</p></p>

<h2>Joystick Third Axis</h2>

<p><img src="../../required/images/icon_note.png"> The Joystick also rotates about its central axis.   By default, there are no functions assigned to this "third axis," but the controller can be customized to take advantage of this feature.  For example, you can map this rotation so that rotating the joystick left or right causes the ROV to turn left or right.
