<h1>Custom Checklists</h1>

<p>The predefined checklists can be customized by editing the definition files.  The definition files are stored in the <span class="folder">VideoRay\CheckLists\</span> folder, which can be found in the computer account user's application data folder (<span class="folder">Users\<i>username</i>\AppData\Local\</span> for Windows 7, or <span class="folder">Documents and Settings\<i>username</i>\Local Settings\Application Data\</span> for Windows XP).  Checklist definitions are store as simple text files.  The file format is one checklist item per line.</p>

<p><img src="../../required/images/icon_note.gif"> The computer account user's application data folder may be hidden, which will require that you enable "Show hidden files and folders."</p>

<p>The file names of the predefined checklist are:</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Checklist</th>
    <th>File Name</th>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Pre-Dive</td>
    <td><span class="folder">Pre-dive.txt</span></td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Post Dive</td>
    <td><span class="folder">Post-dive.txt</span></td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Scheduled Maintenance</td>
    <td><span class="folder">Scheduled Maintenance.txt</span></td>
    </tr>
  </table>

<p><img src="../../required/images/icon_tip.gif"> You might want to preserve the original checklist by copying it to a file with the <span class="folder">.bak</span> extension before editing it.</p>

<h2>Creating New Checklists</h2>

<p>New checklists can also be created and all checklists can be processed using the included stand-alone checklist application without having to run VideoRay Cockpit.  This allows you to create your own operational or equipment checklists.</p>

<p>To create a new checklist, create a text file with the desired checklist items.  For example, a sample remote operations equipment checklist file might have the following contents:</p>

<p>Generator<br />
Gas<br />
Pop-up Tent<br />
Folding Table<br />
Folding Chairs<br />
</p>

<p>The above lines should be stored as a text file with the <span class="folder">.clf</span> extension, such as <span class="folder">remote_equip.clf</span>.  The file can be stored in any location.</p>

<p>To activate the checklist, double click on it.  The results will be stored in the same location as the standard checklists <span class="folder">VideoRay\Checklists\</span>, which can be found in the computer account user's documents folder (<span class="folder">Documents\</span> for Windows 7, or <span class="folder">My Documents\</span> for Windows XP).</p>
