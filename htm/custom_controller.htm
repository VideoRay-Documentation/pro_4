<h1>Hand Controller Mapping</h1>

<p>Any Microsoft<sup>&reg;</sup> Windows<sup>&reg;</sup> compatible game controller can be used with the VideoRay Pro 4 <!--1--> Ultra<!--/1-->.  The hand controller button assignments can be modified to accommodate different controllers and personal preferences.</p>

<p>VideoRay Cockpit currently supports two hand controllers, the VideoRay standard industrial hand controller, and the Logitech<sup>&reg;</sup> Cordless RumblePad<sup>TM</sup> 2.  VideoRay Cockpit will recognize either of these controllers and use the default button mapping.</p>

<p>The button assignment to function mapping is handled through XML configuration files.  Currently there is no graphical interface to modify these files, but the near term software development plan does include adding this capability.  If you want to change the button assignments, the XML configuration files need to be edited by hand.  This is not something VideoRay encourages users to do until the graphical interface is complete, but if you have a need to modify the hand controller button mapping in the meantime, please contact VideoRay for assistance.</p>
