<h1>Compass Calibration</h1>

<p><img src="../../required/images/icon_note.png"> Compass Calibration is not the same as setting the compass declination.  If all you need to do is set the compass to account for local magnetic declination, see the <a href="../../pro_4/html<!--1-->_ultra<!--/1-->/settings_system_compass.html">Compass</a> section under User Settings for information about setting the compass declination.

<p>The compass is calibrated at the factory.  For most operations, the compass should not need to be calibrated.  If you are doing precise survey work or using VideoRay CoPilot's autonomous piloting products, you may need to calibrate the compass.</p>

<p><img src="../../required/images/icon_note.png"> This process does not normally need to be repeated in the field.  If you think there is a problem with the compass calibration, you should contact VideoRay Technical Support for advice before attempting to execute this procedure.</p>

<h2>Basic Procedures</h2>

<p>The specific procedures will depend upon the compass installed in the Pro 4<!--1--> Ultra<!--/1--> ROV.  In general these are the steps that must be performed:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Make sure the sub is configured with accessories in the way it will be used.</li>
  <li>The calibration must be performed with the ROV away from all magnetic / ferrous objects and the person performing the calibration should not have any magnetic / ferrous objects (remove belt buckle, keys, cell phone, etc.).
  <li>Launch the calibration procedure from engine room by clicking on the magnet icon.</li>
  <li>Slowly rotate the ROV so that it passes through all orientations.  The easiest way to do this is to think of the dome as a pain brush and you are painting the inside of a sphere.  Start with the ROV facing straight down.  Lift the ROV in an arc until it faces straight up.  Rotate 15 degrees.  Lower the ROV to face straight down again.  Rotate 15 degrees and repeat this process of up and down arcs until you have rotated a full circle.</li>
  <li>Save the Calibration.</li>
  <li>Check the displayed magnetic heading against a magnetic compass.</li>
  <li>If the calibration does not match the magnetic compass, repeat the calibration sequence.</li>
  </ol>
