<h1>Status Information</h1>

<p>The left hand side of the Engine Room window provides status information including thruster status, raw compass and pressure readings and power supply status.  There is also a display of the firmware version, internal humidity, system run time and communications timing.</p>

<p>Hovering your mouse over the Board ID will display a pop-up window with more details.</p>

<p><img src="../../required/images/icon_note.gif"> The Engine Room status will not be available if the ROV is not connected, or if there is a communications problem showing in the <a href="../../pro_4/html<!--1-->_ultra<!--/1-->/instrument_health.html">ROV Health instrument</a>.

<p><img src="../../required/images/icon_note.gif"> The ROV must be warmed up and the electronics stabilized in order to obtain accurate status readings in the Engine room.  If the ROV is cold, the readings may not be reliable.  ROV warm up time will depend upon ambient conditions, but should not take any more than a few minutes, except in extremely cold conditions.</p>
