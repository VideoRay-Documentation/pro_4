<h2>Accessory Use</h2>

<p>Accessories are supported via an accessory port on ROV that includes power and an interface to the APIC (Auxiliary Pair of Independent Conductors).  The tether includes an APIC for dedicated communications to the topside, where the conductors can be accessed at the AUX connector on the control panel.  The ROV communications bus is also exposed on the accessory port of the ROV allowing a direct interface between VideoRay Cockpit software and the accessory.</p>

<p>Multiple accessories can be connected in parallel by the use of a stackable connector.  The manipulator and cutter do not use a stackable connector, but can be used with other accessories by plugging in their connector as the last one in sequence.</p>

<p><img src="../../required/images/icon_caution.png"> The accessory port must be sealed with a terminated accessory connector or the accessory port terminator dummy plug.  Failure to seal the accessory port may lead to loss of control of the ROV or damage to the components.</p>
