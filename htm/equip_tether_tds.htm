<p>The reel handle is removable and can be stored in the case.</p>

<p><img src="../../required/images/icon_caution.png"> The TDS is not water proof.  Keep the TDS clean, but do not spray the slip ring at the end of the spool opposite from the handle.  Doing so may force dirt into the slip ring and damage its components or lead to corrosion.</p>

<p><img src="../../required/images/icon_note.png"> Wind the tether on the TDS neatly to store the maximum amount of tether.  The standard TDS can hold one 76 meter (250 feet) negative tether, one 76 meter (250 feet) neutral tether and one 40 meter (130 feet) PPT.  The extended capacity TDS can store up to 300 meter (1000 feet) of negative tether.</p>

<p><img src="../../required/images/icon_caution.png"> The Pro 4 TDS cannot be used with the MSS product line.  The voltage rating of the slip ring is not high enough for the MSS vehicle voltage requirement.  The MSS product line requires the use of a qualified MSS TDS.  The Pro 4 and Economy model ROV systems can use either TDS.</p>
