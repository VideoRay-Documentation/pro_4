<h2>Use</h2>

<p>The Camera and Lights Indicator provides feedback on the camera tilt position, camera focus and intensity of the lights.</p>

<p>The Camera Tilt angle relative to the horizontal centerline of the ROV is indicated by the light blue pointer and curved scale, and the tilt angle is also displayed as a number.  The tilt indicator pointer rotates about the central circle to represent the tilt position of the camera.  The tilt angle is displayed as positive number when the camera tilted about the horizontal, and negative when the camera is tilted below the horizontal.</p>

<p>The Camera Focus position is indicated by the white line, and the focus position is also displayed as a number.  When the focus changes from near to far, the focus line moves from the center of the tilt indicator to the outside end of the tilt indicator.  The focus position number ranges from 0 for full near focus to 100 for full far focus.  The scale is not a linear indication of the focus distance.  It is a measure of the focus motor position.</a>

<p>The Camera Switch button can be used to select whether the front or external camera is active.  Click the Camera Switch button to switch from the front camera to the external camera.  Click the Camera Select button again to switch back from the external camera to the front camera.  The title of the Camera Indicator changes to reflect which camera is active</p>

<p>The Camera Menu button can be used to activate the camera menu to make adjustments to the camera settings.  See the <a href="../../pro_4/html/menu_camera.html">Camera Menu</a> section of this guide for more information.</p>

<p>The Camera Tilt Indicator button can be used to activate the camera tilt and focus indicator after using the camera menu.</p>

<p>The Lights Indicator provides feedback on the intensity of the lights as a bar scale and a number.  As the lights intensity increases more bars light up.  The range of the lights indicator number is from 0% for Off to 100% for full On.</a>

<p>The size and display of the Camera and Lights Indicator can be adjusted.  See the <a href="../../pro_4/html/cockpit_instruments.html">Instruments</a> section of this guide for more information.</p>

<p><img src="../../required/images/icon_note.gif"> The feedback is based upon the status of the hand controller input, not the camera action or light intensity.</p>
