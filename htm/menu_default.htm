<h1>Camera Sub-menu: FACTORY DEFAULT</h1>

<p>The Factory Default menu item restores the camera settings to the initial values as configured at the factory.  This menu item does not have any settings and does not open a sub-menu.</p>

<p><img src="../../required/images/icon_note.gif"> Be aware that VideoRay Pro 4 <!--1--> Ultra<!--/1--> does not use the same defaults as the camera manufacturer's Factory Default settings.  For VideoRay Pro 4 <!--1--> Ultra<!--/1--> the Lens Type must be set to "ELC," the ELC Level to "6" and the DSS must be set to "1X" and the WB Mode to "PUSH."  To quickly restore the camera to the recommended <a href="../../pro_4/html<!--1-->_ultra<!--/1-->/menu_videoray.html">VideoRay Pro 4 <!--1--> Ultra<!--/1--> camera menu default settings</a>, first restore the factory default settings, and then change the Lens Type to "ELC" and the Level to "6" in the Lens sub-menu, and change the DSS setting to "1X" in the Exposure sub-menu and the WB Mode to "PUSH" in the White Balance sub-menu.</p>
