<h1>Camera Menu Default Settings</h1>

<p>The default settings for the VideoRay Pro 4 are listed below.  In the Setting column, an <u>underlined</u> value means the setting must be used, "N/A" means the setting is not available for use with the Pro 4, and "User" means the user can select their preference for this setting.  In some cases, user settings are only available in certain modes.  For example, in the White Balance sub-menu, RED CONT is not available unless the White Balance Mode is set to USER.</p>

      <b>1X</b>
      </td>
    <td>
      Digital Slow Shutter allows the camera to collect light over several frames. The number indicates how many frames are used to create an image. Higher numbers can provide better images in low light, but introduce a delay in the video image update rate and may not be practical for piloting. Higher numbers can work well when the VideoRay is stable, and in low light situations this feature may provide better visual penetration than increasing the brightness of the lights. 

      <p>If the light level is sufficient, the Digital Slow Shutter will not be employed.</p>

      <p>If the Digital Slow Shutter is active and the scene being observed changes from dark to light, the video image will turn white while the camera adjusts. The higher the Digital Slow Shutter setting, the longer it will take for the image to return to normal.</p>

    <td>
      Wide Dynamic Range can be used to improve the image quality of a scene that includes light and dark areas. In images without Wide Dynamic Range, either the light areas are too light when the exposure is set for the dark areas, or the dark areas are too dark when the exposure is set for the light areas. Wide Dynamic Range creates underexposed and overexposed frames of each image and combines them to provide good contrast and detail in both the light and dark areas.

      <p>In some lighting conditions, Wide Dynamic Range may make the image looked washed out or pale.  In these situations, turning Wide Dynamic Range off may provide a better image.</p>

      Lower numbers result in the underexposed image being favored, which provides more detail in the light areas, but less detail in the dark areas. Higher numbers result in the overexposed image being favored, which provides more detail in the dark areas, but less detail in the dark areas.
