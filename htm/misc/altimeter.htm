<h2>Tritech Echosounder (Altimeter) Operation</h2>

<p>The altimeter can be used to determine the height of the ROV above the sea floor.  The altimeter can be used with the integration frame or mounted to the ROV skid.  The altimeter must be plugged into the interface cable and the interface cable must be plugged into the ROV accessory port.  The Altimeter interface cable is mounted on the aft starboard side of the integration frame.</p>

<h3>Tips</h3>

<p>The altimeter can be used with the integration frame or directly mounted on the ROV.  Using the altimeter without the integration frame requires a separate mount.</p>

<p>An optional interface cable can be used to connect the altimeter to the ROV so that it uses the spare pair in the tether instead of the communications pair.</p>
