<h2>BlueView ProViewer Imaging Sonar</h2>

<p>The BlueView ProViewer Imaging Sonar was not included in the contract, and therefore information is only provided about the integration of this device.</p>

<h3>Connection Requirements</h3>

<p>IP Address of the Sonar head is typically 192.168.1.45.  The computer must be set to 192.168.1.<i>x</i>, where <i>x</i> is typically 3.</p>

<h3>Exporting Sonar Data to Video</h3>

<p>BlueView allows you to export files to AVI using different video compression algorithms. Some of these algorithms are not supported by Windows Media Player because they require a codec that is not part of the standard installation.  These files may play in other players, such as VideoLan's VLC (<a href="http://www.videolan.org">www.videolan.org</a>).</p>

<p>In order to export a file that will work in Windows Media Player, select the "Microsoft Video 1" video compression algorithm, which is an option when exporting the data.</p>
