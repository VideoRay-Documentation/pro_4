<h2>Dell 4500 / 4600 Computer</h2>

<p>The Dell 4600 has been set up with a "VideoRay" user account and there is no password assigned.</p>

<p>The mount that holds the computer to the control panel is designed to tilt to provide optimal viewing of the second monitor if one is available and to allow easier access to the side ports.  To tilt the computer, lift it straight up and then pull it towards the operator. As it comes towards the operator, the back will start to drop. Continue pulling until the back rests on the control panel.</p>
