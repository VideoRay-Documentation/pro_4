<h2>Hand Controller</h2>

<p>The hand controller is the primary interface to control the ROV and its functions.  VideoRay supports two types of controllers - the VideoRay Industrial controller, and the Logitech Rumblepad.  Both of these devices connect to the computer using a USB cable.  Only one hand controller device can be connected to the computer at a time.  The mapping of the controls to the ROV functions is handled by configuration files.  The configuration files can be found in <span class="folder">C:\Users\VidoeRay\AppData\Local\VideoRay\Controller\</span>.  The configuration files are in XML format, a human readable text format.</p>
