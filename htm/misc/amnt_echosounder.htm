<h2>Tritech Micron Echosounder (Altimeter)</h2>

<p>The Micron echosounder can be used as a stand alone instrument, in which case it requires the spare pair for communications.  It can also be used in conjunction with a PAM, which multiplexes the data onto the ROV communications bus and allows the spare pair to be used for another accessory.  Separate interface cables allow different configurations to be supported:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Direct connect cable</li>
  <li>PAM integrated cable</li>
  <li>Direct connect cable with generic PAM module</li>
  </ul>

<p>When using the PAM interface, the COM port settings should be assigned to Virtual Port Pair 17 and 18.</p>

<p>In all cases, the cable should be connected to the "MAIN" port and the "AUX" port should be sealed.</p>

<p>Software options include the standard Micron application from Tritech or other software that accepts altimeter input.  Contact Tritech for Altimeter output format.</p>

<p>Direct connection of the Micron to the ROV may facilitate diagnostics by separating it from the PAM and being able to isolate the troublesome component.</p>
