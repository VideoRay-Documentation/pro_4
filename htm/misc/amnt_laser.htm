<h2>Laser Scaling Device</h2>

<p>The laser scaling device can be used as a stand alone instrument, in which case it is always in the "On" state.  It can also be used in conjunction with a PAM, which allows switching the beam On and Off remotely from the topide.  For stand alone use, connect the cable directly to the ROV accessory port.  For On/Off use, connect the cable to a generic PAM and connect the PAM to the ROV accessory port.</p>

<p>Direct connection of the laser to the ROV may facilitate diagnostics by separating it from the PAM and being able to isolate the troublesome component.</p>
