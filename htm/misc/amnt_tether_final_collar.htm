<h2>Locking collar Installation</h2>

<p>Repeat these steps for the male and female tether locking collars.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Install the snap ring over the connector. Lubricating the connector and snap ring makes this job easier.</li>
  <li>Work the snap ring over the end of the connector using a small screw driver.</li>
  <li>Use the female threaded locking collar to push the snap ring onto the metal part of the connector. You may need to use a screw driver to get the snap ring past the end of the rubber part of the connection.<p><img src="../../images/tether_snap_ring.jpg" width="600"></p></li>
  <li>IMPORTANT: Use a male threaded locking collar (short) on the female tether connector and a female threaded locking collar (long) on the male tether connector.</li>
  <li>Place the correct locking collar over the connector with the threaded side towards the free end of the connector.</li>
  <li>Screw on the mating locking collar tool and place the assembly in a vise.<p><img src="../../images/tether_locking_collar.jpg" width="600"></p></li>
  <li>Using a pair of small screw drivers, work the snap ring down into the groove in the locking collar.  The groove in the male locking collar is about halfway down and the groove in the female locking collar is at the top.</li>
  <li>Work one side of the snap ring down into the space between the locking collar and the connector.</li>
  <li>Work your way around the connector collar until the snap ring snaps into place in the groove within the locking collar.</li>
  </ol>
