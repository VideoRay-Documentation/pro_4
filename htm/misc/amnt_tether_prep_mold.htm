<h2>Tether Mold Preparation</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Coat both halves of the mold with a light coat of release agent and let them dry for 5 minutes.</li>
  <li>Insert the tether in the mold. For PPT and Negative Tether, the O-ring must be installed on the tether to seal the mold around the tether. For Neutral tether, the O-ring is not needed.<p><img src="../../images/tether_mold_prep2.jpg" width="600"></p></li>
