<h2>Potting the Connections</h2>

<ol>
  <li>You will need to mix 1 pound (0.4545 kg) of potting compound for each tether termination.</li>
  <li>Weigh 77 units by weight of the Flexane Resin into a large plastic cup.</li>
  <li>Add 23 units by weight of the Flexane hardener for a total of 100 units.</li>
  <li>Place the large plastic cup with the mixture in it into a container of hot water(not boiling), ensuring that the water does not enter the mixture.</li>
  <li>Mix the Flexane for at least 2 minutes, while in the heated water.</li>
  <li>Using a heat gun, heat the mold cavity and pour the Flexane mix into the cavity, heating the Flexane while it is being poured.</li>
  <li>Tilt the mold back and forth slightly so that it is completely filled. The Flexane should partially fill the upper funnel
shaped chamber.</li>
  <li>Once the cavity is completely filled, reheat the mixture 2-3 times with heat gun so that air bubbles can escape.</li>
  <li>Place the mold in a safe place and let it cure for 24 hours.<p><img src="../../images/tether_mold_filled.jpg" width="600"></p></li>
  <li>Optional - after 1 hour place the mold under a heat lamp to speed cure.</li>
