<h2>Solder the Connectors</h2>

<p>Repeat these steps for the male and female tether connectors.</p>

<p>A pair of table vises works well to hold the tether and connector in place for soldering.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Each wire from the connector needs to be soldered to the appropriate wire from the tether.  Use the image and table below for reference.</li>
  <li>Slide a 1/2 inch (12 mm) piece of small diameter heat shrink over one wire from the connector and a short piece of large diameter heat shrink over the corresponding wire in the tether.<p><img src="../../images/tether_solder1.jpg" width="600"></p></li>
  <li>Solder the wires one pair at a time.<p><img src="../../images/tether_solder2.jpg" width="600"></p></li>
  <li>After soldering each wire pair, test the continuity before proceeding to the next wire pair.</li>
  <li>Slide the heat shrink pieces so that they overlap over the joint and apply heat to shrink the heat shrink wrap.</li>
  <li>Repeat the process for each wire.</li>
  <li>When all wires have been soldered, apply some rotation to the connector to slightly coil the wires and keep them compact.<p><img src="../../images/tether_solder3.jpg" width="600"></p></li>
  <li>Test all connections for continuity and to ensure there are no shorts.</li>
  </ol>
