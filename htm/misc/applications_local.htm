<h2>Tactical Applications - Local Area Search</h2>

<p>Local area search tactics are used to locate objects when the potential area where the object may be located is small.  "Small" in this case means that the video or an onboard sonar is sufficient to cover the area.   Examples might include a search for a drowning victim, lost object or general exploring of an uncharted area.</p>
