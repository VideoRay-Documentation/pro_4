<h2>Tactical Applications - Wide Area Search</h2>

<p>Wide area search tactics are used to locate objects when the potential area where the object may be located is large.  "Large" in this case means an area that is larger than can be reasonably search using only the video or an onboard sonar.  Generally, in these situations, a side scan sonar is employed to provide suitable coverage rates.  Examples might include a search for a drowning victim, lost object or general exploring of an uncharted area.</p>
