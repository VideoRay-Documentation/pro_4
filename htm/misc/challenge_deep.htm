<h2>Operating in Deep Water</h2>

<p>Working in deep water presents its own set of challenges.  

<ul>
  <li><p>For long tether runs, use negative tether because it can transmit more power and has minimal drag.  A short section of performance or neutral tether should still be used at the ROV unless the tether can always be held above the ROV.</p></li>
  <li>Add a weight to the tether several meters behind the ROV.  Make sure to distribute the stress of the weight connection along a section of tether rather than tying the weight to one point.  Remember, you will need to retrieve the weight, and this can be difficult if the tether is long.<p></p></li>
  <li>To speed descent, grasp a weight in the manipulator.  When you reach your operating depth release the weight in order to be able to pilot the ROV better.<p></p></li>
  <li>Use the vertical thruster to pitch the nose downward, and then use the horizontal thrusters to add more power to your dive or surfacing.<p></p></li>
  </ul>
