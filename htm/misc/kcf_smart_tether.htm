<p>The KCF Smart Tether is a complete position tracking and navigation system that requires zero additional deployment time because it is part of the tether.  Using nodes spaced along the tether, the system can calculate the location of the ROV to within several feet.  In addition to tracking the ROV, the Smart Tether can also provide the location of the tether.  Both visual and sonar coverage can be charted in real-time and exported to mapping applications.</p>
