<h2>Laser Scaling Device Operation</h2>

<p>The Laser Scaling Device can be used to estimate the size of objects within the view of the camera.  The laser can be used with the integration frame or mounted to the ROV skid.  The laser must be plugged into the interface cable and the interface cable must be plugged into the ROV accessory port.  The Laser interface cable is mounted on the forward port side of the integration frame.</p>

<h3>Exercise</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Drive the ROV to an object with the laser off.</li>
  <li>Estimate the size of the object.</li>
  <li>Turn on the laser.</li>
  <li>Estimate the size of the object.</li>
  </ol>

<h3>Optional</h3>

<p>Estimate the maximum distance from an object that the laser can be used effectively to estimate the object's size.</p>

<h3>Tips</h3>

<p>The laser lines are 75 mm apart.  To estimate the size of an object, determine the number of times the object is larger (or smaller) than the size between the lines and multiply that number by 3 and divide by 4.  The result is the size in centimeters.</p>

<p>The interface cable includes a remote from the topside On/Off feature.  If you want the laser to be on all of the time, it can be plugged directly in to the ROV port.</p>
