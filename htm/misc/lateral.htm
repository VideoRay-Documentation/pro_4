<h2>Lateral Thruster Operation</h2>

<p>The lateral thruster can be used to move the ROV sideways.  The lateral thruster is part of the integration frame and cannot be used separately.  The cable must be plugged into the accessory port.</p>

<p>Use the lateral thruster to move along the face of a wall.</p>  Repeat this exercise by driving the ROV parallel to the wall to compare the difference in the ability to inspect the surface using the camera's view and the difference in the ease of piloting the ROV.</p>

<p>Use the lateral thruster to navigate around a piling.</p>  Repeat this exercise using only the horizontal thrusters to compare the difference in the ease of piloting the ROV.</p>

<p>Note that even though it is easier to encircle the piling using the lateral thruster, that may not be the best approach for inspecting pilings  It may be easier to inspect them vertically and then move around the circumference about 90 degrees for the next pass.  This procedure is likely to be quicker and require less tether management.</p>
