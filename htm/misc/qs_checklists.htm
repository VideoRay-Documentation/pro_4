<h2>Checklists and Logs</h2>

<p>Using checklists and logs are critical for effective long term management of assets such as the VideoRay System.  Checklists ensure that procedures are followed, and logs provide a historical perspective of the ROV and can help identify root causes of problems.</p>

<p>VideoRay Cockpit includes online checklist support both from within the program and as a stand alone application.  Checklist content is based on a text file and is easily created for a new checklist or modified for an existing checklist.  Each time a checklist is executed, the operator can be identified and a log file is created when the checklist is completed.</p>

<p>Checklists can be created for universal procedures such as the standard pre-dive and post dive checklists that are included with the system, or for operational and maintenance procedures.</p>

<p>For this class, checklists will be used for pre-dive and post-dive procedures and for parts of the exercises.  The checklist logs will be used for performance assessment.</p>
