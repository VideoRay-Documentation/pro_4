<h2>Video Data Management</h2>

<p>VideoRay stores all video data recorded to an imagery folder, <span class="folder">VideoRay\Imagery\</span> folder, which can be found in the computer account user's documents folder (<span class="folder">Documents\</span> for Windows 7, or <span class="folder">My Documents\</span> for Windows XP).

<p>Still images are stored in .JPG format, while videos are stored in .WMV format by default (Other video formats are available).</p>

<p>Video images can grow to large sizes and this should be taken into consideration.  A rule-of-thumb for the average size is about 1 Gb per hour of recording time.</p>

<h3>Project Organization</h3>

<p>Rather than continue to record all images to the default location, VideoRay recommends that still images and videos be store by project.  You can think of the imagery folder as a transient, not ultimate destination.  Once the ROV operation is complete, files recording during the project should be moved to a separate project folder.</p>

<h3>Data Integrity</h3>

<p>Backing up critical computer files should be part of your standard operating protocol.  In addition to moving the files from the imagery folder to a project folder, it is highly recommended that a separate back up be stored on separate media and in a separate location.</p>

<p>It is highly recommended that all raw image and video data be preserved and when edits are made, they are saved to a new file.  This may allow other future techniques to be applied to the original data.  For example, image enhancement software is a rapidly improving capability.  If you tune an image with current technology, you may not be able to apply more sophisticated methods in the future with effective results.</p>

You can use the My_Notes feature to document your standard operating procedures for managing your video data.</p>
