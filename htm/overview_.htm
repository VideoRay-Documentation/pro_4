<p>VideoRay is pleased to present the latest model in its top-of-the line professional series Micro-ROVs - the VideoRay Pro 4<!--1--> Ultra<!--/1-->.  Like the Pro 3, the Pro 4<!--1--> Ultra<!--/1--> was designed for performance and maintainability, but has entirely new internal electronics, including camera, LED lights, processor, and added sensors. With powerful brushless motors, the Pro 4<!--1--> Ultra<!--/1--> further extends VideoRay's position as the fastest and most powerful tether pulling vehicle.  Additional improvements include deeper depth rating, hydrodynamic streamlining, and optimized ballast adjustment.  Topside control is based on industry standard<!--4--> rugged<!--/4--> computers, with new software that integrates several functions while dynamically reconfiguring for ease of use.</p>

<p>The Pro 4<!--1--> Ultra<!--/1--> submersible builds on VideoRay's strengths with more than twice the vertical thrust of the Pro 3, and 50% greater horizontal thrust.  A depth rating of 300 meters (1000 feet) is standard. Improvements in the electronics allow for both greater total tether length up to 600 meters (2000 feet) and much better power transmission over longer tethers.  Existing VideoRay tethers can be used with the Pro 4<!--1--> Ultra<!--/1--> - and different tether types can still be combined to meet different operational requirements.  New sensors, including 3 axes compass and accelerometers and MEMS gyro improve navigational capabilities.  The primary video camera features ultra low light and Wide Dynamic Range imaging capability, with a wide range of user controllable parameters for demanding imaging situations.  Coupled with the very high intensity LED lighting, the images and video that can be captured are far clearer, particularly in difficult lighting conditions.  An optional external camera can be rotated 360 degrees to provide lateral views as needed.</p>

<p>The topside control configuration replaces inflexible and limited switches and knobs with context-sensitive controls that go beyond simply controlling the submersible to controlling navigation, sonar, image and video capture, and other sensors and accessories in addition to the submersible.  This "systems approach" significantly reduces operator workload and distraction caused by separate systems for sonar, navigation, video capture, and vehicle control.</p>

<p>The Pro 4<!--1--> Ultra<!--/1--> is part of an industry-wide initiative led by VideoRay (the largest volume ROV manufacturer in the world) to go beyond separate "point" technology solutions to a "systems" approach to solving underwater tasks.  The Pro 4<!--1--> Ultra<!--/1--> series ROVs are packaged in configurations such as the PS (Port Security Configuration) and CD (Commercial Dive Configuration) designed to solve a specific or series of underwater tasks, with VideoRay providing comprehensive solutions across the many technologies involved.  Users will be able to concentrate on their underwater missions, not which technology works together and how are the pieces fit together.</p>

<p>Additionally, VideoRay recognizes that technology is only as good as the people who use it.  Successful organizations focus on training and systematic procedures for operations and maintenance.  The VideoRay Pro 4<!--1--> Ultra<!--/1--> package includes features that help owners and operators develop, implement and execute ROV operations and maintenance programs more efficiently and effectively.  These features include customizable documentation, online interactive operating checklists and knowledge and skill assessment tools.  Companies with one system or an entire fleet can leverage these capabilities to ensure that their investment in VideoRay equipment continues to return value throughout its life.</p>
