<h2>IP65 GFCI</h2>

<p>The IP65 Control Panel uses a power cord inline GFCI.  Plug the male plug of the inline GFCI into a power source and plug the Control Panel into the female socket of the Inline GFCI.  </p>

This situation can pose a risk to people handling the tether or in the water with the ROV.  Do not use the LIM bypass switch unless you have examined the system to make sure it is safe, or are sure that people are not going to be exposed to a possible voltage leak in the tether or ROV.</p>

<p>Connector Type - DB-9 Male.</p>

<p><img src="../../required/images/icon_note.png"> The AUX Port provides access to the APIC.  Some accessories use the AUX port directly and the topside device requires a female DB-9 connector.  Some accessory interfaces can be built into the control panel.  For control panels that have built-in accessory interfaces, there is a switch on the back of the control panel that determines whether the APIC is connected to the AUX port, or to the accessory interface inside the control panel.  The switch must be set to the proper position depending upon whether you want to use an external device or the built-in accessory interface.  Set the switch to AUX if you want to use an external accessory device on the topside.  Set the switch to the correct setting for any built-in accessory device that you want to use.  For built-in accessories, there is either another dedicated connector (to connect to the laptop), or the accessory might use USB (to connect to the laptop), in which case a separate connector is not necessary.  See the instructions that come with each accessory for more information.</p>
