<h1>Monitor</h1>

<p>The monitor provides a second display screen for the computer.  The monitor has its own power switch, but is designed to automatically turn on when the control panel is turned on.</p>

<p><img src="../../required/images/icon_note.png"> The monitor receives its power from the power supply in the control panel.  When the control panel is off, the monitor will not turn on.  If the computer is set to display on two screens, you will not be able to see applications or the mouse on the second screen.  you will need to turn on the control panel to see applications and the mouse on the monitor.</a>  

<p>The monitor supports several input sources, but the only input connections accessible are the VGA In, and on some systems the Analog Video In.  The input source selection is controlled by the monitor menu.  The monitor menu also controls the picture quality including brightness and contrast and other picture settings.</p>

<p>For better outdoor viewing in daylight, the Pro 4<!--1--> Ultra<!--/1--> includes a sun shade that mounts on the control panel case.</p>

<p>The monitor includes the following switches:</p>
