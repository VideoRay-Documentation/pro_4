<h1>Monitor</h1>

<p>The monitor provides a second display screen for the computer.  The monitor has its own power switch, but is designed to automatically turn on when the control panel is turned on.</p>

<p><img src="../../required/images/icon_note.png"> The monitor receives its power from the power supply in the control panel.  When the control panel is off, the monitor will not turn on.  If the computer is set to display on two screens, you will not be able to see applications or the mouse on the second screen.  you will need to turn on the control panel to see applications and the mouse on the monitor.</a>  

<p>For better outdoor viewing in daylight, the Pro 4<!--1--> Ultra<!--/1--><!--3--> Lite<!--/3--> includes a sun shade that mounts on the control panel case.</p>

<p><img src="../../required/images/icon_note.png"> The monitor is optional and may not be included with all models.</p>
