<h1>Standard Monitor</h1>

<p>The standard monitor comes in two versions with different brightness, including a standard brightness and Hi-Bright version.  The Hi-Bright version is recommended for daylight viewing.</p>

<p>The monitor supports several input sources, but the only input connections accessible are the VGA In, and on some systems the Analog Video In.  The input source selection is controlled by the monitor menu.  The monitor menu also controls the picture quality including brightness and contrast and other picture settings.</p>
