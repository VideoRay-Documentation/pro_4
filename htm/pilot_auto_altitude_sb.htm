<h2>Additional Notes</h2>

<p><img src="../../required/images/icon_note.png"> Auto Altitude can only be engaged while the depth control knob is centered.  Center the depth control knob before engaging Auto Altitude.  When the depth control knob is centered, the vertical thruster setting indicator is transparent.  When you apply thrust, the vertical thruster setting indicator becomes opaque to provide a visual indication that Auto Altitude cannot be engaged.</p>

<p>When Auto Altitude is Off and the depth control knob is centered, there will be no vertical thrust.  When Auto Altitude is On and the depth control knob is centered, the system will apply thrust as necessary to maintain a constant altitude.</p>
