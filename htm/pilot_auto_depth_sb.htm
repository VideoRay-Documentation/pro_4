<h2>Additional Notes</h2>

<p><img src="../../required/images/icon_note.png"> Auto Depth can only be engaged while the depth control knob is centered.  Center the depth control knob before engaging Auto Depth.  When the depth control knob is centered, the vertical thruster setting indicator is transparent.  When you apply thrust, the vertical thruster setting indicator becomes opaque to provide a visual indication that Auto Depth cannot be engaged.</p>

<p>When Auto Depth is Off and the depth control knob is centered, there will be no vertical thrust.  When Auto Depth is On and the depth control knob is centered, the system will apply thrust as necessary to maintain a constant depth.</p>

<p><img src="../../required/images/icon_danger.png"> When Auto Depth is On, the vertical thruster may spin on its own.  Keep fingers, hair and objects away from the vertical thruster when Auto Depth is On.</p>
