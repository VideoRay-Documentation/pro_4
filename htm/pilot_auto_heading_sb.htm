<h2>Additional Notes</h2>

<p><img src="../../required/images/icon_note.gif"> Auto Heading can only be engaged while the joystick is centered.  Center the joystick before engaging Auto Heading.  When the joystick is centered, the horizontal thrusters settings indicators are transparent.  When you apply thrust, the horizontal thrusters settings indicators become opaque to provide a visual indication that Auto Heading cannot be engaged.</p>

<p>When Auto Heading is Off and the joystick is centered, there will be no horizontal thrust.  When Auto Heading is On and the joystick is centered, the system will apply thrust as necessary to maintain a constant heading.</p>

<p><img src="../../required/images/icon_danger.png"> When Auto Heading is On, the horizontal thrusters may spin on their own.  Keep fingers, hair and objects away from the horizontal thrusters when Auto Heading is On.</p>
