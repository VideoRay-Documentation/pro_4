<h1>Relative Heading</h1>

<p>Relative heading uses the <a href="../../pro_4/html<!--1-->_ultra<!--/1-->/instrument_turns.html">Turns Indicator instrument</a> to represent the directional orientation of the ROV relative to an arbitrary reference direction.  For example, the pilot can adjust the turns indicator so that when the ROV is facing away from the pilot, the turns indicator arrow will point straight up.  When the ROV turns to the right, the arrow will spin to the right by the same amount.</p>

<h2>Set up</h2>

<p>To set up the turns indicator for relative heading use, follow these steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p></p>Position the ROV so that its forward direction is aligned with the direction you want the Turns Indicator arrow to point straight up. Typically, this will be with the ROV facing in the same direction the pilot is facing, but it could also be aligned with a local landmark such as a pier or a ship.</li>
  <li><p></p>Open the <a href="../../pro_4/html<!--1-->_ultra<!--/1-->/settings_turns_indicator.html">Turns Indicator settings</a> and click on the compass icon.</li>
  <li><p></p>The Turns Indicator arrow will be rotated so that is it straight up.</li>
  </ul>

<h2>Use</h2>

<p>The Turns Indicator arrow will now be aligned with the ROV's direction relative to the pilot or selected land mark.</p>

<p>The Base Heading value will be displayed at the top of the Turns Indicator dial and a small blue mark indicating the magnetic heading of 0 will be displayed just inside the perimeter of the dial.</p>
