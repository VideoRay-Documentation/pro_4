<p><img src="../../required/images/icon_tip.png"> While you will likely find the Pro 4<!--1--> Ultra<!--/1--> easy to pilot, we strongly recommend that your first dive be conducted in a controlled environment such as a small tank or pool.  As you gain experience with your system and confidence in using it, you will be able to operate in more challenging conditions that might include low visibility, currents and potential hazards that could snag your tether or trap your ROV.</p>
