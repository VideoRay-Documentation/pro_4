<h1>Quick Start Instructions</h1>

<p>These Quick Start Instructions are streamlined to cover just the essentials of operating your Pro 4<!--1--> Ultra<!--/1-->.  They are provided to get you started as fast as possible, while keeping you and the equipment safe.  They cover the equipment set up and basic operation, but are not intended to result in a comprehensive base of knowledge or set of operational and piloting skills.  The remaining sections of this documentation should be referenced for a complete understanding of the features, capabilities, operating procedures and maintenance requirements of the Pro 4<!--1--> Ultra<!--/1-->.</p>

<p><img src="../../required/images/icon_tip.gif"> While you will likely find the Pro 4<!--1--> Ultra<!--/1--> easy to pilot, we strongly recommend that your first dive be conducted in a controlled environment such as a small tank or pool.  As you gain experience with your system and confidence in using it, you will be able to operate in more challenging conditions that might include low visibility, currents and potential hazards that could snag your tether or trap your ROV.</p>
