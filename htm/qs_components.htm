      <h2>ROV</h2>
      <p>The ROV, or Remotely Operated Vehicle, carries the cameras, lights and sensors or accessories to the underwater places you want to observe.  Thrusters provide mobility and these systems are controlled from the surface using the control panel and hand controller.
      <p>See the <a href="../../pro_4/html/equip_rov.html">ROV</a> section of the <a href="../../pro_4/html/equip_.html">Equipment Guide</a> for more information.</p>

        <h2>Control Panel</h2>
        <p>The control panel includes the system's power and communications modules, computer and hand controller, and serves as the operator's console and video display.  Open the control panel and familiarize yourself with the components and primary controls on the hand controller.  See the <a href="../../pro_4/html/equip_panel.html">Control Panel</a> and <a href="../../pro_4/html/equip_controller.html">Hand Controller</a> sections of the <a href="../../pro_4/html/equip_.html">Equipment Guide</a> for a complete description of all of the controls and connections.

      <h2>Hand Controller</h2>
      <p>The hand controller is used to pilot the VideoRay and operate other features like the lights, camera controls and manipulator.  The hand controller is pre-programmed, but can be customized to meet specific user or operational needs.

      <h2>Tether / TDS (Tether Deployment System)</h2>
      <p>The tether connects the ROV to the control panel.  It delivers power and control signals to the ROV, and returns video and sensor data (optional) from the ROV to the surface.  Some systems come with a TDS (Tether Deployment System), that makes the work of managing the tether easier.   The tether is also often referred to as the umbilical.</p>
