<p>At the conclusion of your dive, retrieve the VideoRay and power down the system by closing VideoRay Cockpit, shutting down the computer and turning off the Power switch.  Make sure the ROV is secure before disconnecting the tether.  After disconnecting the tether, keep the tether connectors clean and do not let them drag on the ground.</p>

<p>Proper maintenance of your VideoRay system ensures a long service life and that it will be ready to operate when you are.  After each dive, you should visually inspect the system for damage that might have occurred during your operation.</p>

<p>VideoRay Cockpit includes an online interactive Post Dive checklist.  See the <a href="../../pro_4/html/service_postdive.html">Post Dive Checklist</a> section of the <a href="../../pro_4/html/cockpit_.html">VideoRay Cockpit Guide</a></p>

<p><img src="../../required/images/icon_note.gif"> Keeping the ROV clean is one of the most important aspects of good preventative maintenance practices, especially after using it in salt water.  If you use your ROV in salt water, or water with contaminants, you should first rinse it, and then soak it in clean fresh water for at least one-half hour.  After cleaning the ROV and tether, they should be allowed to air dry before being put away for storage.</p>
