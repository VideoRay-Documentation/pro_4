<p><img src="../../required/images/icon_tip.png"> Select a safe and preferably level area to set up the control panel.  See the <a href="../../pro_4/html<!--1-->_ultra<!--/1-->/pm_operations.html">On-site Operations</a> section of the <a href="../../pro_4/html<!--1-->_ultra<!--/1-->/oper_pm.html">Project Management Guide</a> for more information about site selection and set up.</p>

<p>The pre-dive preparations consist of three parts, a visual inspection before setting up the system, setting up the system including making connections, and power on tests of the system's safety circuits and primary functions.</p>

<p>VideoRay Cockpit includes an online interactive Pre-Dive checklist.  See the <a href="../../pro_4/html<!--1-->_ultra<!--/1-->/service_predive.html">Pre-Dive Checklist</a> section of the <a href="../../pro_4/html<!--1-->_ultra<!--/1-->/cockpit_.html">VideoRay Cockpit Guide</a></p>

<h2>Conduct a Visual Inspection</h2>

<p>Assuming this is your first time using the VideoRay, everything should be in proper working order and ready to go, but it is good practice to perform a pre-dive inspection before every dive, even your first.  If any problems are noticed, refer to the <a href="../../pro_4/html<!--1-->_ultra<!--/1-->/mnt_diagnostics.html">Diagnostics and Repair</a> section of the <a href="../../pro_4/html<!--1-->_ultra<!--/1-->/../../pro_4_mnt_n/html/index.html">Maintenance Guide</a> and take appropriate corrective action, or contact VideoRay for assistance before commencing the dive.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Inspect the ROV and other system components to make sure there are no visible signs of damage or loose or worn parts.  Also check for water inside the ROV hull by holding it with the front facing downward and look for signs of water in the main dome or light domes.<p></p></li>

  <li>Check the horizontal thrusters to make sure that the shafts are not bent and the propellers are free to spin and are not fouled, loose or binding on the thruster guards.  Check the thruster cartridge seals - they are filled with oil and there should be no signs of leaking or contamination.  A small air bubble in a thruster cartridge seal is acceptable.  See the <a href="../../pro_4_mnt_n/html/index.html">Maintenance Guide</a> for <a href="../../pro_4_mnt_n/html/mnt_cartridge_seals.html">warnings, replacement criteria, examples and replacement procedures</a>.<p></p></li>

  <li>Check the vertical thruster to make sure the shaft is not bent and the propeller is not fouled or loose or binding on the float block.  Also, check the thruster cartridge seal following the same guidelines used to check the horizontal thruster cartridge seals.  Make sure the accessory port at the rear of the ROV is sealed with either a connector from an attached accessory or an accessory port terminator plug.  Removal of the float block by loosening the retaining screw may facilitate this process.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Make the Connections</h2>

<p><img src="../../required/images/icon_caution.png"> Connecting or disconnecting cables while the system is powered on is not recommended.</p>

<p>Most of the cables have been connected at the factory.  See the appropriate sections of the <a href="../../pro_4/html<!--1-->_ultra<!--/1-->/equip_.html">Equipment Guide</a> for detailed information about each of the connections.</p>

<p>You will typically need to connect only the hand controller, tether and power cord.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Connect the hand controller to one of the USB ports on the back of the control panel or directly to one of the USB ports on the computer.<p></p></li>

  <li>Connect the female end of the tether connector to the ROV.  The connectors have one pin that is offset towards the center of the connector.  Make sure the connectors are clean, align the pins, and push the connectors together - do not twist the connectors.  Secure the locking collar by screwing the halves together, and connect the strain relief cable from the ROV to the braided strap on the tether.<p></p></li>

  <li>Connect the male end of the tether to the control panel.  When not in use, keep the tether connectors clean and protected for the best performance and reliability.<p></p></li>

  <li>Plug the control panel power cord into a conventional power source (100-240 Volts AC, 50,60 Hz).  Power can be supplied through a land-based power outlet, generator or battery and inverter.  See the <a href="../../pro_4/html<!--1-->_ultra<!--/1-->/equip_panel.html">Control Panel</a> section of the <a href="../../pro_4/html<!--1-->_ultra<!--/1-->/equip_.html">Equipment Guide</a> for power source requirements.<p></p></li>
  </ol>

<h2>Power On Tests</h2>

<p><img src="../../required/images/icon_danger.png"> <img src="../../required/images/icon_caution.png"> If the system does not pass any of the following tests, it should not be used until the problem is identified and corrected.  See the <a href="../../pro_4/html<!--1-->_ultra<!--/1-->/mnt_diagnostics.html">Diagnostics and Repair</a> section of the <a href="../../pro_4_mnt_n/html/index.html">Maintenance Guide</a> for more information.</p>
