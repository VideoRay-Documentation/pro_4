<h2>Product Evolution</h2>

<p>The ballast weight system has been revised.  The current system uses push buttons to open the skid pods and stainless steel weights with a square cross section.  Earlier versions used brass weights with a round cross section, and the pods were held closed by O-ring bands.</p>

<p><img src="../../required/images/icon_note.gif"> The older round weights will fit in the new pods, but the newer square weights will not fit in older pods.</p>
