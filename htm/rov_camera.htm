<h1>Main Camera</h1>

<p>The ROV includes a main camera in the front of the main hull, which can be tilted and focused from the surface using the hand controller.  Panning the camera is accomplished by turning the ROV.</p>

<p>The camera has numerous features including the following highlights:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Switchable between Color and Black and White<p></p></li>
  <li>Automatic White Balance<p></p></li>
  <li>Wide Dynamic Range<p></p></li>
  <li>Back Light Compensation<p></p></li>
  <li>Digital Slow Shutter<p></p></li>
  <li>1 - 2.5X Zoom<p></p></li>
  </ul>

<p>The complete list of camera features and how to control them are described in the <a href="../../pro_4/html<!--1-->_ultra<!--/1--><!--3-->_lite<!--/3-->/menu_camera.html">Camera Menu</a> section of the <a href="../../pro_4/html<!--1-->_ultra<!--/1--><!--3-->_lite<!--/3-->/cockpit_.html">VideoRay Cockpit Guide</a></p>

<p>The video circuit in the ROV is switchable between the main camera and a video conductor pair on the ROV accessory port.  This allows external cameras to be used as well, but only one camera can be viewed at a time when using this method.

<p><img src="../../required/images/icon_note.png"> The ROV, control panel and tether, also support an APIC (Auxiliary Pair of Independent Conductors) that can be used to provide a second simultaneous video feed.</p>

<p><img src="../../required/images/icon_caution.png"> The main camera resides behind an acrylic dome.  The dome should be cleaned with soap and water.  Do not use products that contain alcohol, because this can create stress cracks in the dome.</p>

<p><img src="../../required/images/icon_tip.png"> The front and rear domes are the same and can be interchanged.  If the front dome is scratched, the rear dome can be moved to the front.</p>
