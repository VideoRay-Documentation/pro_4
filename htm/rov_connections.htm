<h2>Accessory Port</h2>

<p>The ROV accessory port provides power, access to the ROV communications bus and the APIC (Auxiliary Pair of Independent Conductors) to the surface.  Most accessories, with the exception of the manipulator and cutter, use a stackable pass through connector that allows multiple accessories to be connected to the accessory port in parallel.</p>

<p><img src="../../required/images/icon_caution.png"> The accessory port must be sealed with a terminated accessory connector or the accessory port terminator dummy plug.  Failure to seal the accessory port may lead to loss of control of the ROV or damage to the components.</p>

<p><img src="../../required/images/icon_note.png"> Accessory Port pin numbering is as follows.  When looking at the mating end of the connector with the row of 5 sockets or pins on top - For female connectors, pin 1 socket is at the right end of the row of 5 sockets, and pins 2-5 sockets proceed from right to left.  Pins 6-9 sockets are in the lower row and proceed from left to right.  For male connectors, pin 1 is at the left end of the row of 5 pins and pins 2-5 sockets proceed from left to right.  Pins 6-9 are in the lower row and proceed from right to left.</p>
