<h1>Sensors</h1>

<p>In addition to the camera, the ROV includes several other sensors that provide feedback to the pilot about the ROV and the environment it is in.</p>

<p>ROV sensors include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Pressure Sensor</b> - Indicates the depth of the ROV.<p></p></li>
  <li><b>3 Axes Compass</b> - Indicates the heading of the ROV<p></p></li>
  <li><b>3 Axes Accelerometers</b> - Indicates the attitude of the ROV<p></p></li>
  <li><b>Water Temperature</b> - Indicates the water temperature of the water surrounding the ROV.<p></p></li>
  <li><b>Internal Temperature</b> - Indicates the internal temperature of the ROV.<p></p></li>
  <li><b>Internal Humidity</b> - Indicates the relative humidity of the air inside the ROV.<p></p></li>
  </ul>

<p>The information provided by these sensors is conveyed to the pilot via instruments in VideoRay Cockpit, and some items including the depth, compass heading and temperature can be overlaid on the video.</p>

See the <a href="../../pro_4/html<!--1-->_ultra<!--/1-->/settings_system.html">System Settings</a> tab of the <a href="../../pro_4/html<!--1-->_ultra<!--/1-->/control_settings.html">User Settings</a> for information on how to select the system of units.</p>
