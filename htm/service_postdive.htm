<h1>Post Dive Checklist</h1>

<p>The Post Dive checklist provides a consistent structure to follow and conduct the post dive operations.  The results can be logged and can include the name of the person conducting the post dive procedures.  Each item of the checklist can be marked as pass, fail or N/A, which could mean the step does not apply or was not conducted.  Notes can be added to each step.</p>

<p>Completed Post Dive checklists are stored in the <span class="folder">VideoRay\Checklists\</span> folder, which can be found in the computer account user's documents folder (<span class="folder">Documents\</span> for Windows 7, or <span class="folder">My Documents\</span> for Windows XP).</p>

<p>The Post Dive checklist can be customized.  See the <a href="../../pro_4/html<!--1-->_ultra<!--/1-->/custom_checklists.html">Checklist Customization</a> section of the <a href="../../pro_4/html<!--1-->_ultra<!--/1-->/custom_.html">Customization Guide</a> for more information about customizing the Post Dive Checklist.</p>
