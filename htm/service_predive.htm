<h1>Pre-Dive Checklist</h1>

<p>The Pre-Dive checklist provides a consistent structure to follow and conduct the pre-dive operations.  The results can be logged and can include the name of the person conducting the pre-dive procedures.  Each item of the checklist can be marked as pass, fail or N/A, which could mean the step does not apply or was not conducted.  Notes can be added to each step.</p>

<p>Completed Pre-Dive checklists are stored in the <span class="folder">VideoRay\Checklists\</span> folder, which can be found in the computer account user's documents folder (<span class="folder">Documents\</span> for Windows 7, or <span class="folder">My Documents\</span> for Windows XP).</p>

<p>The Pre-Dive checklist can be customized.  See the <a href="../../pro_4/html/custom_checklists.html">Checklist Customization</a> section of the <a href="../../pro_4/html/custom_.html">Customization Guide</a> for more information about customizing the Pre-Dive checklist.</p>
