<p>The camera has a sophisticated menu system to adjust various settings to achieve the optimal quality image under a variety of conditions.  Likewise, the video capture system has similar settings to adjust how the image is converted from analog to digital.  You can adjust the Brightness, Contrast, Hue, Saturation and Sharpness of the image.  The Default button can be used to restore the factory default settings.</p>

<img src="../../required/images/icon_note.gif"> The camera menu will affect the image display on both the analog Video Out and computer.  The Video Capture and Display settings only affect the digital image displayed and recorded on the computer.</p>
