<h1>Depth Gauge Settings</h1>

<p><img src="../../pro_4/images/usersettings_instruments_depth_highlight_scaled.png"></p>

<p>The Depth Gauge tab of the Instrument Settings tab allows you to adjust the depth gauge scale and altimeter settings.  You can set the minimum depth, the maximum depth and the grid spacing displayed on the depth gauge.  These properties can be set by entering values or by clicking with the left mouse button and dragging the sliders.   You can drag the grid slider to adjust the grid spacing.  You can drag the top green bar to set the minimum depth, you can drag the bottom green bar to set the maximum depth, or you can drag the blue bar to change both ends of the range simultaneously</p>

<p><img src="../../required/images/icon_note.png"> The Depth scale values can not be set to less than 0, or greater than 1000, and the grid spacing cannot be set to less than 1 or greater than 100.</p>

<p><img src="../../required/images/icon_note.png"> If the ROV surfaces or dives outside of the range defined for the depth gauge, the depth flag will stop at the end of the gauge, but the depth number will continue to update to provide an accurate indication of the depth of the ROV.</p>

<h2>Restoring Factory Defaults</h2>

<p>The factory default settings for instruments can be restored by clicking on the Restore Factory Defaults button in the upper right hand corner of the Instruments Settings window.</p>
