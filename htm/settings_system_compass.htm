<p>The ROV compass system is designed to display headings relative to Magnetic North.  You can enter a local compass variation to account for magnetic declination.  The declination is considered positive when the Magnetic North is East of True North.</p>

<p>The value you enter is numerically added to the heading from the ROV.  For example, if you are in an area with a declination of 15 degrees West, the ROV heading will read +15 degrees when the ROV is facing True North (assuming no variation has been entered).  You should therefore enter -15 for the variation, which would result in a correct True North reading of 0 when the ROV is pointed True North.</p>

<p><img src="../../required/images/icon_note.png"> The declination is saved from session to session.  Be sure to clear it or change it at the start of each session if necessary.</p>

<p><img src="../../required/images/icon_note.png"> Beginning with version 1.8 of VideoRay Cockpit, the behavior of the Compass Variation has been reversed.  In prior versions, the variation was subtracted from the ROV heading.</p>
