<h1>Depth Sensor</h1>

<p><img src="../../pro_4/images/usersettings_systemsettings_depth_scaled.png"></p>

<p>The Pro 4<!--1--> Ultra<!--/1--> depth gauge is calibrated at the factory and in general does not need calibration.  The Pro 4<!--1--> Ultra<!--/1--> will automatically zero the depth on start up as long as the pressure is below an internally defined threshold.  This will allow the system to take into account differences in barometric pressures from one project to the next.  The system will not zero the depth on start up if the pressure is above the threshold.  This will allow you to turn the system off and then back on while the ROV is submerged without affecting the depth reading.</p>

<h2>Depth Calibration</h2>

<p>If you want to manually zero the depth, you can do so by clicking on the "Use current pressure" button.</p>

<p>On the right hand side, you can adjust the calibration to account for the density of the fluid in which you are operating the ROV.  There are quick preset buttons for Fresh or Salt Water, and there is a pull down list with more quick preset fluid types.  You can also enter the density directly if it is known.</p>

<p><img src="../../required/images/icon_note.png"> When adjusting the calibration to account for the density, the number value is the governing parameter.  The pull down menu selection may be out of sync with the number value in use.  Closing the User Settings window and reopening it will resynchronize the values.</p>

<p>In the upper right hand corner of the Depth Sensor section, there is a button to access the Depth Sensor Advanced Settings.</p>
