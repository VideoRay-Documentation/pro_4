<h1>System Voltage Caution</h1>

<p>Historically, the tether voltage to power the ROV has been increasing.  Economy models (including the Scout, Explorer and Voyager), Pro 3 variants and the Pro 4 Ultra use 48 V DC for vehicle power.  The Pro 4 uses 74 V DC.  The MSS (Mission Specialist Series) uses 400 V DC with plans to use higher voltages in the future.  Systems with voltages higher than 48 V DC include a LIM (Line Insulation Monitor) protection module in the ROV DC circuit.</p>

<p><img src="../../required/images/icon_caution.png"> System components should not be connected to voltage sources higher than their rating.</p>

<p><img src="../../required/images/icon_note.png"> The Pro 4 Ultra uses the same ROV as the Pro 4 and is rated at 36 V DC to 74 V DC input.  The power supply for the Pro 4 Ultra is limited to 48 V DC maximum output.  The Pro 4 Ultra ROV is safe to use on a standard Pro 4 control panel.</p>

<p>VideoRay Negative, Neutral and PPT tethers are rated to 600 V DC and are safe to use on any system through the MSS 400 V DC.</p>

<p><img src="../../required/images/icon_caution.png"> The standard TDS and Extended TDS are only rated to 300 V DC and should not be used with MSS power components that have red locking collars.</p>

<p>The new version of the extended TDS is available that includes a 600 V rated slip ring.</p>
