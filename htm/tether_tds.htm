<p>The TDS comes in two sizes: standard and extended capacity.  Both have the same exterior physical dimensions, but the extra capacity TDS can store more tether.</p>

<p>The reel handle is removable and can be stored in the case.</p>

<p><img src="../../required/images/icon_caution.png"> The TDS is not water proof.  Keep the TDS clean, but do not spray the slip ring at the end of the spool opposite from the handle.  Doing so may force dirt into the slip ring and damage its components or lead to corrosion.</p>

The standard TDS can hold one 76 meter (250 feet) negative tether, one 76 meter (250 feet) neutral tether and one 40 meter (130 feet) PPT.  The extended capacity TDS can store up to 300 meter (1000 feet) of negative tether.</p>
