<h1>Compatibility Issues between the Pro 3 and Pro 4 <!--1--> Ultra<!--/1--></h1>

<p>There are several compatibility issues between the Pro 4 <!--1--> Ultra<!--/1--> and prior versions.

<h2>Control Panel</h2>

<p>The control panel has been changed significantly from the Pro 3 to the Pro 4 <!--1--> Ultra<!--/1--><!--4-->.  The Pro 4 <!--1--> Ultra<!--/1--> uses 74 Volts DC in the tether, while the Pro 3 uses 48 Volts DC<!--/4-->, and the communications protocol was changed.

<p><img src="../../required/images/icon_caution.png"> Do not attempt to plug a Pro 3 ROV into a Pro 4 <!--1--> Ultra<!--/1--> control panel, or a Pro 4 <!--1--> Ultra<!--/1--> ROV into a Pro 3 control panel.  Doing so may cause damage to the components.</p>

<h2>Accessory Port</h2>

<p>The accessory port has been changed from the Pro 3 to the Pro 4 <!--1--> Ultra<!--/1-->.  The table below lists the changes.</p>

<h2>Lights</h2>

<p><img src="../../required/images/icon_caution.png"> The Pro 3 and Pro 4 <!--1--> Ultra<!--/1--> lights are not interchangeable between these two systems even though the connectors are the same.  Using a Pro 3 light bulb on a Pro 4<!--1--> Ultra<!--/1--> ROV, or a Pro 4 <!--1--> Ultra<!--/1--> LED on a Pro 3 ROV may cause damage to the lights or the ROV.

<h2>Manipulator</h2>

<p><img src="../../required/images/icon_caution.png"> The Pro 3 and Pro 4 <!--1--> Ultra<!--/1--> manipulators are not interchangeable between these two systems even though the connectors are the same.  Using a Pro 3 manipulator on a Pro 4<!--1--> Ultra<!--/1--> ROV, or a Pro 4 <!--1--> Ultra<!--/1--> manipulator on a Pro 3 ROV may cause damage to the manipulator or the ROV.  You can tell the difference between Pro 3 and Pro 4 <!--1--> Ultra<!--/1--> manipulators by the length of the main body.  The Pro 3 body is about 75 mm (3 inches), while the Pro 4 <!--1--> Ultra<!--/1--> body is about two times as long at 150 mm (6 inches).  The Pro 3 manipulator uses pins 7 and 8 for + or - 24 Volts DC to drive the motor.  The Pro 4 <!--1--> Ultra<!--/1--> manipulator includes a processor board to allow multiple manipulators to be used on one ROV.  On the Pro 4 <!--1--> Ultra<!--/1--> manipulator, pins 7 and 8 are used for communications, pins 3 and 5 are used for power (24 Volts DC) and pin 12 is used to power the processor board (12 Volts DC, converted to 5 Volts DC on the board).</p>

<h2>Calibration</h2>

<p>The Pro 4 <!--1--> Ultra<!--/1-->'s depth gauge and compass do not need to be calibrated.</p>

<h2>Run Time</h2>

<p>The run time of the Pro 3 is stored in the control panel.  The run time of the Pro 4 <!--1--> Ultra<!--/1--> is stored in the ROV.  This provides a more accurate representation of the amount of hours of use of the ROV.</p>

<h2>Tether</h2>

<p>VideoRay tether can be used with any model.  The maximum tether length of the Pro 4 <!--1--> Ultra<!--/1--> has been increased from about 365 meters (1,200 feet) for the Pro 3 to about 600 meters (2,000 feet).</p>
